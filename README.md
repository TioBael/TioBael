# Hi and Welcome!

I'm Luis Costa, an undergraduate student of Computer Science on Estacio Uni. at Brazil.
I'm interested in Java and ~~CSharp~~~ Frontend tech like Javascript, right now I'm studying Angular. Some times I fumble on some tech security reading, trying to understand and failing, but it's a learning process, right?
